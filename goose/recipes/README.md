# Goose Recipes

Ready-to-use Goose recipes you can drop into your workflow. Each recipe includes the JSON configuration, a `goose://` URI for quick import, and customization guidance.

## What's Here

- [code-qa-with-docs.md](./code-qa-with-docs.md) — Deep code review with project documentation context
  - Designed for projects using the `llm/` directory structure from [new-project-boilerplate](https://github.com/pleb-devs/new-project-boilerplate). Goose reads your phase requirements, implementation notes, and project standards before reviewing code—catching discrepancies between docs and actual implementation.

## Choose a Path

- Using the PlebDevs boilerplate with `llm/` docs? Start with **code-qa-with-docs** for deep reviews that verify code against your documentation.
- Want to create your own recipe? Use any recipe here as a starting template and customize the instructions.
