# Maple Guides

Use these guides to work with Maple’s encrypted LLM products across API and apps.

- [Maple API (OpenAI-compatible proxy)](./maple-api.md)
- [Maple App Quickstart](./maple-app-quickstart.md)
- [Maple Image Upload](./maple-image-upload.md)
- [Maple Document Upload](./maple-document-upload.md)

Follow the main repo template (Overview, Setup, Beginner usage, Pro usage, Cost savings, Privacy, Security) when adding new Maple docs. Keep links relative and avoid tracking params. Screenshots should be lightweight and only where they clarify a flow (not required to read the docs).
